## 1. Problem Statement:

Speech, like images, text, and others, has certain characteristics that can be analyzed to extract semantic features and used in various domains.

Artificial intelligence has made significant advancements in the field of speech and has achieved remarkable progress in understanding, analyzing, and working with speech. Generally, artificial intelligence in speech encompasses several areas such as sound classification, speech recognition, speaker recognition, and more.

One of these domains is speech recognition, which is widely used in everyday life nowadays. Examples include virtual assistants like Alexa and Cortana, customer support services, translation, video subtitles, voice commands, and more. Simply put, speech recognition means converting speech into text. After extracting the semantic features of speech, it can also be transformed into text.

In artificial intelligence, automatic speech recognition refers to machines and computers being able to analyze and decode speech based on learning, and then convert it into text.
